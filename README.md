# Huffman-encoder
Used huffman algorithm to encode text into array of numbers
You can add any text to it according to the instructions provided during execution of application.
It will convert the text into array of elements with datat type long long.
One character from original text takes up 1 byte storage while one long long takes up 8 bytes to store an element but the array size is very small and the encoded array takes less than half of the space taken by original text.
